A web app that monitors phone battery percentage and gives an alert when the battery reaches a certain limit

> Even though there are many applications, I just wanted to build one of my own

### Tech stack:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Battery Status API:navigator.getBattery()

### ‚ùó Keep in mind

‚ö† Battery API works only on secure contexts (HTTPS)

‚ö† Some browsers don't support navigator.getBattery()

- Chrome, Edge, and some Android browsers support it. Safari (iOS) does not support it, so it won't work on iPhones
